![Awesome RSI — A Research Map of Recursive Self-Improvement](assets/awesome-rsi-map.png)

# Awesome RSI (Recursive Self-Improvement) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) refers to processes in which AI systems improve their own capabilities and can also improve the mechanisms that generate subsequent improvements.

Recent progress in self-training, agent memory, harness optimization, embodied self-improvement, automated AI research, self-modifying coding agents, and evolutionary search has made RSI increasingly relevant as an empirical research direction rather than only a theoretical idea.

Awesome RSI collects and organizes important work across these areas, including model-level self-improvement, context and memory evolution, harness and scaffold evolution, embodied and physical self-improvement, multi-agent systems, automated AI research, benchmarks, and safety.

Not every work listed here demonstrates RSI in the strict sense. Some represent bounded self-improvement or enabling techniques that may contribute to more complete recursive systems.

If you are new to the topic, start with Fundamentals & Getting Started. If you already know the basics, explore the sections most relevant to your interests.

This is a community-maintained and evolving list. Contributions, missing papers, new benchmarks, frameworks, and suggestions for improving the taxonomy are very welcome.

The taxonomy is organizational rather than mutually exclusive; many systems span multiple layers and mechanisms.

## Scope & Terminology

For this list, we use the following operational distinctions:

**Self-refinement** — improves the current output without a persistent change to the system.

**Persistent self-improvement** — changes to weights, memory, skills, prompts, harness, or code that carry into the next round.

**Recursive self-improvement** — the mechanism that produces improvements is itself the object of improvement.

**RSI substrate** — exposes an agent's own structure as a modifiable object, but does not necessarily form an automatic self-improvement loop by default.
